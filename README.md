With over 800 pokemon in some games, the team combinations and strategies are limitless. You must understand a pokemon stats to predict how they will perform in battle and to create a powerful team. I have obatined data on all pokemons stats from Genration 1 to Genration 6 or the Pokemon X and Pokemon Y games that came out in October 12, 2013 on the Nintendo 3ds. The goal of my project is to analyze the data within the Pokemon Stats csv, and determine what top 10 pokemon have the best total stats in each generation. This analysis will help even the most novice of players make the best team no matter what generation they are playing.
